This system is designed to support universities by shifting information management and academic resources in an online, user friendly environment to support all stakeholders like Students, Instructors, and Teaching Assistants to engage with academic content within the institution. The goal is to create an efficient platform such as simplifying the use of assignment grades and locating resources for the users.

### Database technologies:
MySQL, Jupyter Notebooks, Linux and Git

### Entities
Other than the core entities (Students, Instructors, Teaching Assistants), there are thirteen more entities that made up the whole database system, including Course, Exams, Grades, Assignments, Discussion Groups, Attendance Records, Resources, Modules, Course Announcements, Office Hours, Feedback, Profile and Notifications.
